# OpenAI Platform Usage Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to log into the OpenAI platform, view your API key, and check your remaining token balance.

## Prerequisites

- An OpenAI account. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
- Access to the OpenAI platform dashboard.

## Instructions

### 1. Log into the OpenAI Platform

1. Go to the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Click on the **Sign In** button in the top-right corner.
3. Enter your registered email address and password, or sign in using Google if you have linked your account.

### 2. View Your API Key

1. Once logged in, navigate to the **API Keys** section:
   - Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
   - Select **View API Keys** from the dropdown menu.

2. You will see a list of your existing API keys. If you don’t have an API key yet, click on the **Create new secret key** button.

3. Copy the API key displayed, and store it securely. You will need it to authenticate your API requests.

   **Important:** Never share your API key publicly, as it can be used to access your account.

### 3. Check Your Token Usage

1. Navigate to the **Usage** section:
   - Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
   - Select **Manage Account** from the dropdown menu.
   - Click on the **Usage** tab on the left-hand side.

2. You will see a detailed view of your token usage, including:
   - **Daily Token Usage**: A breakdown of how many tokens you’ve used each day.
   - **Cumulative Token Usage**: A graphical representation of your cumulative token usage over time.

3. You can filter the data by date range using the date picker at the top of the page.

### 4. Check Your Remaining Token Balance

1. Go to the **Billing** section:
   - Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
   - Select **Manage Account** from the dropdown menu.
   - Click on the **Billing** tab on the left-hand side.

2. You will see your billing details, including:
   - **Current Balance**: The amount spent so far in the current billing cycle.
   - **Usage Limits**: Your daily and monthly usage limits.

3. To view your remaining token balance, compare your current usage with your monthly limit. This will give you an idea of how many tokens you have left.

### 5. Additional Information

- If you need to manage your API keys, navigate to the **API Keys** section and click on the **Revoke** button next to an existing key to deactivate it.
- For detailed usage reports or to view invoices, go to the **Billing History** section under **Billing**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot Access API Key**: If you can't access your API key, ensure that you have appropriate permissions. Contact OpenAI support if you need further assistance.
- **Exceeded Usage Limits**: If you have exceeded your usage limits, consider upgrading your plan or adjusting your usage settings in the **Manage Account** section.
